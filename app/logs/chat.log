[2026-01-21T09:38:52.761Z] USER: 1. I very often meet women who don't choose me. Most of my dates become friends who enjoy my company but explicitly don't want anything romantic. 
2. I think my greatest fear is being with the wrong partner, and missing the real thing.

I'll normally be very interested in her, ask her questions and focus on the conversation. If I'm very interested I'll sometimes try to create phyisical intimacy, but sometimes this feels awkward and will be met with little reciprocation - I think this is the deep pain blocking my energy and making everyhting awkward

As starter I decided to build small mobile up and pumping them on the mobile app markets, like this very Tarot app we're talking on right now. Maybe I can simply answer some needs of people privately. If this works, and I see that I can solve problems with AI, I'll approach smbs and start up teams to see if I can do this for them.

[2026-01-21T12:31:05.011Z] USER: See, I'm currently developing this very app we talking on and I plan to put on mobile app stores to see if I can make a living from developing small, in-demand apps. But this may the wrong move, as technology progresses there will be lots of competition by people with stronger dev capabilites. Then again, I'm a decent PM, maybe vibe coding is what my career has been waiting for to go solo? 
I'm asking myself if this is the right direction, or maybe I should find a more bespoke niche. 

And to yo...

I wouldn't rule it out if I can see that I can provide value, but it feels a bit out of reach. Evevry unemployed developer, every code studio is doing this exactly. I started a project like that for the business of a friend, and right before the end he decided to continue with an existing provider who just swithced to automatin services.. so.....

The app store thing is just my first start to prove to myslef that I can actually build a fully functioning mobile app with user accounts, payments and heavy traffic.
from there Here's my honest read: shipping small consumer apps also has brutal headwinds. Discoverability is hard, competition is brutal, and most indie app developers don't make real money. The reason the Queen of Pentacles (your outcome card) doesn't look like "viral app success" is because that's not...

He's an entrepeneur currently developing an app that helps romatic partners to be better partners. I'll do some opperations and some vibe coding tasks for now. They'll launch in a few months and then we'll see what's up. 
Could the wheel of fortune have pointed to this opportunty that "fell out of the sky" at the right moment?
